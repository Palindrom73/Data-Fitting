During my master's degree, I attended a course on nuclear reactor physics with some experiments on our small nuclear reactor at TU Dresden. I used Python to analyse the data. This repository contains only a selection of the written code.

There is a code for the data regarding the critical experiment for the correct loading of the core with nuclear fuel and a code for the differential control rod characteristic for one of the rods. If you are interested I can provide the integral characteristic and some other code concerning such experiments.
